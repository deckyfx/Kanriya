# Multi-Tenant Architecture Implementation Progress

## Session Summary
**Date**: 2025-08-24
**Objective**: Implement multi-tenant architecture with PostgreSQL schema isolation as outlined in MULTI_TENANT_ARCHITECTURE.md

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Master Schema Entities
- ‚úÖ Created `Business` entity (`/src/Kanriya.Server/Data/Business.cs`)
  - Stores tenant metadata (ID, name, subdomain, schema, database user, encrypted password)
  - Includes business settings, plan limits, and status tracking
  - Supports business lifecycle (Active, Suspended, Deleted)

- ‚úÖ Created `BusinessRegistry` entity (`/src/Kanriya.Server/Data/BusinessRegistry.cs`)
  - Maps users to businesses with roles (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer)
  - Tracks primary business assignment
  - Maintains tenant-specific user IDs

- ‚úÖ Added Entity Configurations
  - `BusinessConfiguration.cs` with proper indexes and constraints
  - `BusinessRegistryConfiguration.cs` with composite unique indexes

### 2. PostgreSQL Management Service
- ‚úÖ Created `PostgreSQLManagementService` (`/src/Kanriya.Server/Services/PostgreSQLManagementService.cs`)
  - `CreateDatabaseUserAsync()` - Creates PostgreSQL users with secure passwords
  - `CreateSchemaAsync()` - Creates isolated schemas for businesses
  - `GrantSchemaAccessAsync()` - Manages permissions
  - `DropSchemaAsync()` / `DropUserAsync()` - Cleanup operations
  - Schema and user existence checking

### 3. Tenant Connection Service
- ‚úÖ Created `TenantConnectionService` (`/src/Kanriya.Server/Services/TenantConnectionService.cs`)
  - Dynamic connection string building per tenant
  - Password encryption/decryption using AES
  - Connection string caching for performance
  - `TenantDbContext` definition for tenant-specific operations
  - Connection validation methods

### 4. Business Service
- ‚úÖ Created `BusinessService` (`/src/Kanriya.Server/Services/BusinessService.cs`)
  - `CreateBusinessAsync()` - Full business creation with schema and user
  - User management within businesses (add/remove)
  - Business status management (activate/suspend)
  - Access control validation
  - Schema migration capabilities
  - Transaction-based operations for consistency

### 5. Dual Authentication System
- ‚úÖ Created `DualAuthService` (`/src/Kanriya.Server/Services/DualAuthService.cs`)
  - Principal token generation for master schema access
  - Business token generation for tenant-specific access
  - Token validation with type checking
  - Support for multiple businesses per user
  - Token claim extraction utilities

### 6. CLI Commands
- ‚úÖ Created `BusinessCommands` (`/src/Kanriya.Server/Commands/BusinessCommands.cs`)
  - `business list` - List all businesses
  - `business add` - Create new business
  - `business info` - Show business details
  - `business activate/suspend` - Status management
  - `business delete` - Remove business (with confirmation)
  - `business add-user/remove-user` - User management
  - `business migrate` - Schema migration

### 7. Service Registration
- ‚úÖ Updated `MailServiceConfig.cs` to register all multi-tenant services
  - PostgreSQLManagementService (Singleton)
  - TenantConnectionService (Singleton)
  - BusinessService (Scoped)
  - DualAuthService (Scoped)

### 8. Database Migration
- ‚úÖ Created migration `AddMultiTenantSupport`
  - Adds `businesses` table
  - Adds `business_registry` table
  - Includes all necessary indexes and foreign keys

### 9. Email Template Integration
- ‚úÖ Updated `UserService` to use database templates instead of hardcoded HTML
  - SendActivationEmailAsync now uses SendTemplatedEmailRequest
  - Added SendWelcomeEmailAsync method
  - Template variables properly injected

## ‚úÖ Migration Applied

**Date**: 2025-08-24 (Session 2)
- Migration `20250824075651_AddMultiTenantSupport` has been successfully applied to the database
- Database tables `businesses` and `business_registry` are now created

## üöß Pending Tasks

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Fix CLI Integration**
   - Business commands are implemented but not integrated with main program
   - Need to hook BusinessCommands into the program's command system
   - Currently blocked: `dotnet run -- business list` doesn't recognize the command

2. **Test Business Creation** (After CLI fix)
   ```bash
   dotnet run -- business add --id acme --name "ACME Corporation" --owner admin@example.com
   ```

3. **Verify Schema Isolation** (After business creation)
   - Check PostgreSQL for created schema
   - Verify user permissions are correctly restricted

### GraphQL Integration Tasks

1. **Create Business Mutations**
   - `createBusiness` - GraphQL mutation for business creation
   - `updateBusiness` - Modify business settings
   - `suspendBusiness` / `activateBusiness` - Status management
   - `deleteBusinesss` - Soft/hard delete options

2. **Create Business Queries**
   - `myBusinesses` - List user's businesses
   - `businessInfo` - Get business details
   - `businessUsers` - List users in a business

3. **Update Authentication Mutations**
   - Modify `signIn` to return dual tokens
   - Add `switchBusiness` mutation for changing active business
   - Add `refreshBusinessToken` for token renewal

4. **Create Business Subscriptions**
   - `onBusinessChanged` - Business updates
   - `onBusinessUserAdded` / `onBusinessUserRemoved`
   - `onBusinessStatusChanged`

### Middleware & Authorization Tasks

1. **Create Tenant Context Middleware**
   - Extract business ID from token
   - Set TenantDbContext for requests
   - Validate business access

2. **Update Authorization Policies**
   - Business-specific role checking
   - Owner-only operations
   - Cross-business access prevention

3. **Request Pipeline Integration**
   - Add tenant resolution to HTTP pipeline
   - Configure GraphQL context with tenant info
   - Handle multi-tenant subscriptions

### Testing & Validation

1. **Integration Tests**
   - Business creation flow
   - User assignment and removal
   - Schema isolation verification
   - Token validation

2. **Security Tests**
   - Cross-tenant access prevention
   - SQL injection in schema names
   - Permission escalation attempts

3. **Performance Tests**

## Current Status & Next Steps

### ‚úÖ Completed Implementation Checklist

**When user creates a new business:**
- [x] Business record added to default schema with PostgreSQL credentials
- [x] New PostgreSQL schema created (format: `biz_${uuid}`)
- [x] New PostgreSQL user created with full access to that schema only
- [x] Tenant schema tables created (users and user_roles)
- [x] Business owner user created with API credentials (16-char secret, 32-char password)
- [x] BusinessOwner role assigned to created user

### üîß Architecture Implementation
- **Business Table**: Stores only ID, name, schema, PostgreSQL user/password
- **Tenant Schema**: Each business has isolated `biz_${uuid}` schema
- **API Authentication**: Business users authenticate with API-SECRET/API-PASSWORD
- **Role System**: 
  - Principal roles: SuperAdmin, StandardUser
  - Business roles: BusinessOwner (expandable in future)

### üìù Authentication Flows

**Principal User Login:**
```
Email + Password ‚Üí Master DB validation ‚Üí Principal Token
```

**Business User Login:**
```
API-SECRET + API-PASSWORD + Business-ID ‚Üí 
  Get PostgreSQL credentials from business table ‚Üí
  Connect to tenant schema ‚Üí
  Validate credentials ‚Üí
  Return Business Token
```
